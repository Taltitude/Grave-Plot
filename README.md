# Grave-Plot
A digital scrolling grave plot
This project is a reflection on what death looks like in a digital space. On facebook and instagram we have infinite scroll, almost an unending life of information. 
But does our information live there, or does it get memorialized there? A death being a memorial to a life lived; does a digital life constantly memorialize it'self (1995 - present). Memorialize itself by the nature  that a real person curates a digital self, a digital self that exists removed from the natural self. 
the project simply works to dig/scroll into the ground to get a to an empty casket. My question and where this project may fall flat is whether the casket should be empty or is something that could have a "digital body"?
